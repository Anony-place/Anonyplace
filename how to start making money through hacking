 
How to Earn Legally Through Ethical Hacking

Hacking often carries a negative connotation, but not all hacking is illegal. In fact, ethical hacking is one of the most in-demand and high-paying careers in the cybersecurity industry. If you have a passion for hacking and want to make money legally, this guide will show you various ways to turn your skills into a profitable and ethical career.
What Is Ethical Hacking?

Ethical hacking (also called white-hat hacking) involves identifying security vulnerabilities in systems, networks, and applications to help companies strengthen their security. Ethical hackers use the same techniques as cybercriminals, but instead of exploiting weaknesses, they report and fix them.

Companies, government agencies, and even Fortune 500 brands hire ethical hackers to test their systems. This means you can earn a great income legally while improving cybersecurity worldwide.
